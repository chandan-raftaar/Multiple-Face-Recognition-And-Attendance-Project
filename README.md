# Multiple-Face-Recognition-And-Attendance-Project
It has 2 methods of detecting a face
   m1:Inbuilt library of python 
    
   m2:
    Deep learning algorithm to detect the face where it contains a generic algorithm by 
    this we can just change the libraries over here and it will work for every other different types of transfer learning techniques.
    
 And lastly extracting the names of the faces from the screen and printing on the csv file.
